# Repository Guidelines

## Divine Context And Brain

Before broad product, architecture, protocol, cross-repo, service-boundary, or pull-request authoring, review, or modification work, read the shared Divine context primer.

Resolve the context directory and clone it there if it is missing:

```bash
CONTEXT_DIR="${DIVINE_CONTEXT_ROOT:-../divine-context}"
[ -e "$CONTEXT_DIR/.git" ] || gh repo clone divinevideo/divine-context "$CONTEXT_DIR"
```

Use that value as `<context-dir>` below.

The `divine-context` repo is private, so cloning requires GitHub access. If clone, network, or auth fails, continue from the local repo docs and avoid cross-repo assumptions.

Before updating an existing context checkout, verify it is clean and on its default branch. If it is clean and on the default branch, update it with `git -C <context-dir> pull --ff-only`. If it is dirty, on another branch, cannot fast-forward, or network/auth fails, leave it untouched and say the context may be stale.

Read `<context-dir>/AGENT_CONTEXT.md` and follow its instructions. If unavailable, continue from the local repo docs and avoid cross-repo assumptions.

Before working on a pull request, follow `<context-dir>/PR_REVIEW.md` and use `<context-dir>/PR_REVIEW_TEAMS.md` to request the normal team and check takeover authority. Ordinary review remains open to any eligible Divine human. Before modifying a pull-request branch, enforce the mapping and every takeover gate; if the mapping cannot be read, feedback-only review may continue but automated takeover must stop. Request and verify required human review automatically when tooling permits. If the runbook is unavailable, leave the pull request open and report the blocker.

If a Divine Brain search or ask tool is available, you may use it for company memory. Treat it as optional and credentialed: tool names vary by client, and work must continue when Brain is unavailable. When Brain results influence work, cite the returned document ids. Never commit Brain credentials or expose Brain-derived sensitive content in public PRs, issues, branch names, commit messages, code comments, logs, screenshots, release notes, or externally shared agent transcripts.
## Project Structure & Module Organization
- Worker code lives in `src/`.
- D1 schema changes live in `migrations/`.
- Project metadata and scripts live in `package.json`; deployment config lives in `wrangler.toml`.
- Keep request routing, provider integration, queue handling, and persistence logic separated where practical instead of expanding a single large Worker module.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `npm install`: install dependencies.
- `npm run dev`: start the Worker locally with Wrangler.
- `npm test`: run the test suite when tests are present and configured.
- `npm run deploy`: deploy the Worker through Wrangler.
- If schema or provider behavior changes, validate them against the D1 migrations and relevant API paths before opening a PR.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Use TypeScript throughout and keep request, queue, and persistence shapes explicit.
- Prefer focused helpers and endpoint-specific logic over broad shared utility buckets.
- Keep PRs tightly scoped. Do not mix unrelated cleanup, formatting churn, or speculative refactors into the same change.
- Temporary or transitional code must include `TODO(#issue):` with the tracking issue for removal.

## Pull Request Guardrails
- PR titles must use Conventional Commit format: `type(scope): summary` or `type: summary`.
- Set the correct PR title when opening the PR. Do not rely on fixing it afterward.
- If a PR title changes after opening, verify that the semantic PR title check reruns successfully.
- PR descriptions must include a short summary, motivation, linked issue, and manual test plan.
- Changes to public endpoints, provider webhooks, queue behavior, or moderation actions should include representative payloads or request examples when helpful.

## Security & Sensitive Information
- Do not commit API keys, webhook secrets, private moderation payloads, or sensitive customer data.
- Public issues, PRs, branch names, screenshots, and descriptions must not mention corporate partners, customers, brands, campaign names, or other sensitive external identities unless a maintainer explicitly approves it. Use generic descriptors instead.
